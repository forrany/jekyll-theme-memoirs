Today is my first day as a member of the “Volunteer in Shenzhen” . My task is the “Shenzhen Mangrove-Bay Bird Protection ” .My duty is to work in the  bird-protection cabin, where I am responsible for greeting visitors and promoting our activity.

I explained the number, species, and living conditions of the wild birds in Shenzhen to visitors from all over the world, as well as our bird protection measures. We also actively conducted the “Blue Ocean” charity fundraising . As part of the event, we gave out various creative and interesting products to the public. For example, this adorable blue dolphin plushie—children love to play with it, and it will cultivates their passion for the ocean and marine animals subtly.

Here are some pictures and descriptions of the mangrove birds. The Black-faced Spoonbill is undoubtedly the superstar of Shenzhen’s wild bird !

Green-winged Teals and Grey Herons are also frequently seen in Mangrove Bay. Turning their images into postcards, fridge magnets, and pins not only makes them more accessible to the public but also helps spread knowledge about wildlife.

Visitors to Mangrove Bay come from all over the world. Sometimes, I answer questions in English for foreign tourists. Other times, I practice my still-improving Cantonese when interacting with visitors from Hong Kong and Macau. And occasionally, I chat with children, who are just learning to talk—those moments are especially fun!

How I wish that my small contributions, combined with the efforts of countless others, can help Mangrove Bay remain as beautiful as it is today, and wild birds can always live here freely and peacefully.
